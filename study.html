            <h2 id="titlesection">Where can we study Astrophysics? </h2>

                <div class="longparagraph">
                    <p>First we have to understand one thing <strong>you can't study astrophysics as first career or undergraduate</strong>, astrophisics is a master, so it means that you must study other career first, this first career can be: 
                    </p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Maths</li>
                        <li>Physics</li>
                        <li>Astronomy</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Once we have one of this careers we can apply to study the master in astrophysics, here in Colombia, there's not good options to study astrophysics, so the best idea to study astrophysics is go abroad and study in a country like: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>United States</li>
                        <li>Canada</li>
                        <li>United Kindom</li>
                        <li>Any other country in europe</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Or even we can try to study online, there's many oportunities to study online currently, although personally I would rather to study prescencially.</p>
                    <p> There's many options to study astrophysics in the named countries, theres options like study directly with the NASA or in many universities I'm going to focus in the universities of the UK like these:</p>

                    <p>I'll take the requirements of the University of Oxford as reference, because in my case is the university where I'd like to study astrophysics.</p><br>
                    <p>Knowing that the best choice to study astrophysics is go abroad we should have a great level of english, enough to understand the technical language, so the ideal is have a C1 or at least a B2 level, although is better to have the C1 certified.</p><br>
                    <p>However as we alredy said we must have an undergraduate in maths, physics or astronomy</p>
                    <p>Else we must have solid bases in maths and physics, that includes knowledge in: </p>

                    <p>Once we've presented the exam, one proccess of selection will be executed, if we pass this selection proccess we'll be interviewed. In case of being selected after this proccess we can say that we are in</p><br>
