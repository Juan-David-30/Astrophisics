                    <p>Astrophysics is a branch of space science that applies the laws of physics and chemistry to seek to understand the universe and our place in it. The field explores topics such as the birth, life and death of stars, planets, galaxies, nebulae and other objects in the universe, is important not confuse astrophysics with its two siblings, astronomy and cosmology.

                        <li><strong>Astrophysics</strong> creates physical theories of small to medium-size objects and structures in the universe.</li>
                        <li><strong>Astronomy</strong> measures the positions, luminosities, motions and other characteristics of celestial objects.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cosmology</strong> covers the cosmos' largest structures and the universe as a whole.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <p>although if we're honest, when we study astrophysics we'll have to learn things of cosmology and of astronomy</p>

                    <p>Also in astrophysics we are going to learn comology, data science, programming and computing science. </p><br>
                    <p>In astrophysics we must to learn the most important theories of the world through the story and in the present in many fields of the physic, like in the quantum physic, clasic physic, optica, thermodinamics,electromagnetism  and cosmology</p>

                    <p>Astrophysics is a science very beautiful that seeks to answer many of the questions that all the humanity has had since millions of years ago, about ourselves and  the universe in the one we live</p><br>
                    <p>Astrophysics are fundamental not just since a phylosophic way, astrophysics is the way to evolve as humans challenging our knowledge and technology in the seek of the knowledge about the universes</p><br>
                    <p>So we may conclude that the astrophysics has the objetive of challenge the humanity in his knowledge to oblige us to evolve in knowledge and understanding </p>

                    <p>Astrophysics needs a lot of knowledge in many areas, thanks to that the astrophysicans can work in many fields, of course we can work for things related to the space, like in any space agency, in an observatory or else, but besides that we can work in fields related to te software or data science, even we can work as an engineer in many fields or of course as a physicist</p><br>
                    <p>As we can see, an astrophysicst is somebody who has lots of knowledge in many fields, this allow the astrophysics to work in many areas and do many professions</p>
